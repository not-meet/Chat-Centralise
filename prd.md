[11:25 AM, 1/11/2025] Wasim Memon: For a company in scaling in Mexico. I just need the bare structure to run on this business and I can develop it into a more robust and potentially put it in the market.

As of now I just need to have an interface working with business whats app API where multiple agents can provide customer support.

The business offers medical affiliation to different insurances in Mexico.

The customer journey goes
Meta ads➡️ website form ( it’s already done ) or directly to what’s app message ➡️ CRM ( we use Monday and we can keep it for now )
[11:25 AM, 1/11/2025] Wasim Memon: I would just want to see how long it would take to create a basic functional one to be used internally this one I do need it as soon as possible as the growth of the business is started to get affected by a lack of internal tool.

The goal is to just have a sales/customer support funnel on what’s app using their business api to handle messages at scale

[11:25 AM, 1/11/2025] Wasim Memon: Functionally must just have multiple agents, ability to send broadcast messages and some notes of each customer
[11:25 AM, 1/11/2025] Wasim Memon: It can be a stripped down version of this
